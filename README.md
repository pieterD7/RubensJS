# RubensJS

RubensJS is a fast svg wrapper like RaphaelJS with a 2D coordinate system and basic charts like pie, column, bar, map and linegraph.

It is a collection of the js objects from https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N3JX17RPTD4 

Visuals take the sizes of their parent html container. The common data structure is : 

```javascript
{ label: x, data:[{to:y1, to:y2, ...}]}
