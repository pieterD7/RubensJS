# RubensJS

RubensJS is a fast svg wrapper like RaphaelJS with a 2D coordinate system and basic charts like pie, column, bar, map and linegraph.

The visual takes the sizes from the parent container in html. Most objects can be swiped through with the dependency of HammerJS in the directory 'external'. The data structure is mostly an x value with an array of to-values. A WIKI page is comming on ...

It is a collection of the js objects from https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N3JX17RPTD4
